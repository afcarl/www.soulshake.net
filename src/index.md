# What am I looking for?

Why yes, I *am* looking for a job.

If I could snap my fingers and find myself in a perfect role, it would probably involve:

- making the world better
- writing useful tools (libraries, CLIs) that make the humans who use them happy
- playing with APIs, integrating things into other things
- automating things and making them document themselves
- talking to people and enabling them to do cool shit
- subverting the dominant paradigm, in general

Right now the tools\* I'm equipped with are:

- Golang, Python, bash
- a little C, C++ and Ruby
- DNS, Docker, see linkedin profile
- an endlessly stubborn personality when faced with a problem or a mystery, whether it's a complicated-ass bug that no one else will look into or somebody's long-lost best friend from 6th grade
- near-native fluency in French, and caveperson-level Russian, German, Spanish
- an incorrigible curiosity, a sort of fierce empathy and incorruptible rage at injustice
- an obsession with well-made things and awesome documentation
- a pretty good holistic perspective, seeing connections/the "big picture"
- an endless supply of ideas and hypotheses
- a tiny bit of a bunch of other things, due to the aforementioned curiosity
* some/most of these have gotten me into trouble at some point, so YMMV.
